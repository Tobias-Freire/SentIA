## About
A sentiment analysis project. It uses a bunch of technologies such as Spring Boot, FastAPI, Streamlit, sentiment analysis models, MongoDB, Apache Kafka and Docker. It is too much for a simple project like this, but I wanted to learn these things :) 

> It is still in **development phase**. I will gradually update things and in the future there will be a better documentation explaining how to run all the services of this project.
